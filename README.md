# Retail Insights: A Comprehensive Data Mining Approach to Customer Behavior Analysis

## 📊 Overview

In the modern digital economy, retailers are flooded with data, but only those who can turn this raw information into actionable insights can maintain a competitive edge. This project, titled **"Retail Insights: A Comprehensive Data Mining Approach to Customer Behavior Analysis"**, demonstrates how data mining techniques can be applied to real-world retail transaction data to extract meaningful business intelligence.

Using a structured dataset of customer transactions, we implement key data mining tasks — **Association Rule Mining**, **Classification**, **Clustering**, and **Outlier Detection** — to identify purchasing trends, segment customers, predict spending behavior, and highlight anomalies. The project provides a modular learning experience aligned with academic units in data mining and is implemented entirely in Python using open-source libraries.
